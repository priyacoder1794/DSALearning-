// What is a Stack?
// A stack is a linear data structure that allows operations to be performed at one end, called the top. The two primary operations are:


// Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
// Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
// Extreme Conditions in a Stack
// Stack Underflow:
// Occurs when you try to perform a pop or peek operation on an empty stack.
// Handling: Check if the stack is empty before performing these operations.
// Stack Overflow:
// Occurs when you try to push an element into a stack that has reached its maximum capacity (in languages or implementations where the stack size is fixed).
// Handling: Check if the stack is full before performing a push operation.


// Operations Performed on a Stack
// Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
// Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
// Peek (or Top): Returns the top element without removing it.
// isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
// Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
